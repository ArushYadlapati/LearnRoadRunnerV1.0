These wheels have rotary encoders to track distance traveled. This data is fed through a kinematic equation and integrated to calculate the relative position of the robot on the field.

At the time of writing, the three-wheel configuration is the most accurate option. This is because the Rev Expansion/Control Hub utilizes a slow I2C implementation which results in about 7ms per I2C call. The BNO055 IMU onboard the Rev Expansion/Control Hub communicates via I2C. This will contribute a signficant amount of delay to your loop times which reduces integration accuracy (the 7ms is in addition to the 3ms call for all dead wheels assuming bulk reads, so 10ms). To calculate the heading with a two-wheel configuration, it must call on this slow IMU for heading. A three-wheel configuration calculates heading via the two parallel wheels, which eliminates the 7ms I2C call. Since all three of your dead wheels can be read in 3ms (assuming bulk reads and that all your encoders are on one Rev Expansion/Control Hub), the loop time is greatly reduced.
